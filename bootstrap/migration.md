Other changes :

- Bootstrap 5 introduces a new data attribute naming structure. `data-*` attribute has been renamed to `data-bs-*`.
- Bootstrap 5 now provides easier customizations on the v4 theming pages and provides code snippets to build using Bootstrap's Sass files.
- Bootstrap 5 has added a new accordion component that includes icons that have a state and can be clicked. The accordion-flush class can be used to remove the default background color, borders, or corners to possibly render accordions edge-to-edge with the parent element.
- Bootstrap 5 documentation site is now enhanced to improve the user readability, and new examples have been added with code snippets.
- The inline-block property is removed in Bootstrap 5, and the dropdown-menu-dark class now loads with a default black dropdown.
- The support for jumbotron has been terminated in Bootstrap 5.
- With vertical classes in Bootstrap 5, the columns can be positioned relative.
- Gutters can now be applied using g* class instead of gutter. The font size is now set to rem instead of px.
- Lastly, Bootstrap 5 also adds a new offcanvas component that enables you to create hidden view panes that would pop out when you interact with component tied to it -- e.g., side navigation bars, shopping carts, etc. Here is an example of the bottom offcanvas component.
